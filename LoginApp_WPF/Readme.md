## Login App in WPF 


A small form app for logging in to a seperate dashboard form ,
with Username and Password validation in a local Database.

> Username and password are :  **admin**  **admin**   (or the secret one !)

> In this app the credentials are stored in a table , best option for this would be that these should be encrypted (for example with a SHA encryption ).
